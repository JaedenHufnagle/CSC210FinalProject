TO DO LIST :
- make navigation to preliminary database from main
  - redirect them to their profile
    - their profile will have " create blog post button " 
  - email verification (figure that out somehow) <-- done at a later date

FUNDAMENTALS:
- we need html pages (just rough outlines for now)
- we need basic CSS to just make it not confusing to read
- 

DATABASE:
- buttons for CRUD
- page for simple outline
  - page for first SPRINT to display all information in it while it's being edited
- maybe make page for user to add blog / log in 


1st SPRINT : Hopefully this wednesday 11/25 before noon (very basic outline just basic html, database, possible CSS, and possible prototype for user page and blog input)
